      I said I would never change, I would never leave you
      Told you I would never lie, you said "I believe you"
      That's when everything was clearer, back when shit was see-through
      Then murky waters came to part us, now you're in my rearview
      And I ran, and I fell, something like your tears do
      And I know you tried to tell me, but I couldn't hear you
      Girl, it never should've ended like that
